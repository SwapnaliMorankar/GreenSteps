        <p class="vision-description">
            At GreenSteps, we envision a world where sustainability is not a choice, but a way of life. Our goal is to foster a culture where individuals, communities, and organizations unite to protect and nurture the environment.
        </p>
        <p class="vision-highlight">Every Step Counts. Every Voice Matters.</p>
        <p class="vision-details">
            We believe that meaningful change begins with awareness, and grows through collective action. GreenSteps is built on the principle that small, consistent effortsâ€”like reducing waste, conserving energy, and supporting local green initiativesâ€”can lead to transformative impact.
            <br /><br />
            Our platform serves as a bridge between intention and action. It empowers users to track their eco-friendly habits, participate in sustainability campaigns, and collaborate with changemakers across the globe. Whether you're a student planting trees, a business adopting green practices, or a citizen reporting environmental issues, GreenSteps is your companion in making a difference.
            <br /><br />
            Through education, innovation, and community engagement, we aim to inspire a generation that values the planet as much as progress. Join us in shaping a future where sustainability is woven into every decision, every project, and every step we take.
